# Dry_Bean_Project
Classification of Dry Bean with Machine Learning Models
**_Project Overview**_
The Dry Bean Dataset Machine Learning Project aims to classify different types of dry beans based on various morphological features. The dataset contains 13,611 instances of dry beans, which belong to seven different categories. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to achieve accurate classification of the dry bean types.
**_Dataset Description**_
The dataset used in this project is the Dry Bean Dataset, which can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Link is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset
**_Project Notebooks**_
The notebooks directory contains Jupyter notebooks for detailed data exploration, preprocessing, and model training. You can run these notebooks to get an in-depth understanding of each step in the project pipeline.
