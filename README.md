# Dry_Bean_Project
Comparison of Machine Learning Models on Dry Bean Classification
**_Project Overview**_
The Dry Bean Dataset Machine Learning Project aims to classify different types of dry beans based on various morphological features. The dataset contains 13,611 instances of 7 registered categories of dry beans consisting of 16 features. This project involves exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation to achieve accurate classification of the dry bean types. Feature importance using the permutation importance method was carried out on the models to identify the featues of the dataset that significantly impacted the performance of each model. The models developed are Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using Keras Sequential Framework.
**_Dataset Description**_
